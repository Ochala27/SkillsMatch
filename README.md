The problem
As a founder, I have lived the life of a busy professional. Balancing work demands with personal responsibilities often left me struggling to find quick and trustworthy solutions for home maintenance, repairs, or even finding a tutor for a last-minute session. I vividly recall a time when a plumbing issue disrupted my workday, and the hours spent trying to find a reliable plumber only added to my stress. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of the frustrations and inefficiencies that busy professionals face daily.
